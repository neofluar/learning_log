# learning_log
This is a web app called "Learning Log" that allows users to log the topics they’re interested in and to make journal entries as they learn about each topic. The "Learning Log" home page should describe the site and invite users to either register or log in. Once logged in, a user should be able to create new topics, add new entries, and read and edit existing entries. The app is deployed on herocu.com.

When you learn about a new topic, keeping a journal of what you’ve learned can be helpful in tracking and revisiting information. A good app makes this process efficient!
